CFLAG-BD: Blockchain-Based Clustered Federated Learning with Deduplication of Model Weights

This repository contains the source code, models, experiments, and documentation for the paper:

CFLAG-BD is a privacy-preserving and communication-efficient federated learning framework that:
- Dynamically clusters clients based on multi-dimensional criteria (data similarity, processing power, reliability, architecture).
- Integrates a blockchain-based deduplication mechanism to prevent redundant model updates.
- Supports deployment in heterogeneous edge environments (e.g., IoT, mobile, healthcare).
- Achieves scalability up to 10,000 clients with minimal blockchain overhead.
